# YOLOv5-for-Remote-Sensing-Object-Counting
This repository contains the code for remote sensing object counting using the YOLOv5 algorithm.


## Dataset 
* Download RSOC_small-vehicle datasets from [here](https://github.com/gaoguangshuai/Counting-from-Sky-A-Large-scale-Dataset-for-Remote-Sensing-Object-Counting-and-A-Benchmark-Method). This dataset is collected from the [DOTA dataset](https://captain-whu.github.io/DOTA/dataset.html), which is a very large dataset built for object detection in aerial images. The following are some example images from the RSOC_small-vehicle dataset.
